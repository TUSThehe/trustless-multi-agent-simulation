### Trustless Multi-Agent Simulation

This project demonstrates a simplified version of a **Trustless Multi-Agent Framework**, a decentralized alternative to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It showcases key concepts in creating autonomous, distributed agents that interact without centralized control, using simulated blockchain records and a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for governance.

#### Key Features:
- **Distributed Key Management**: Each agent generates and manages its own cryptographic keys for secure interactions.
- **Blockchain Simulation**: Actions taken by agents are recorded on a local blockchain ledger for transparency and traceability.
- **DAO Governance**: Agents can propose and vote on upgrades, enabling decentralized decision-making.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents perform tasks autonomously, demonstrating a scalable, distributed system.

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/greaterdan/trustless-multi-agent-simulation.git
   cd trustless-multi-agent-simulation
   ```

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This command initializes the multi-agent simulation. Youâ€™ll see agents performing actions, adding records to the blockchain, and voting on DAO proposals in the terminal output.

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- Install any dependencies if needed (none are specified in `requirements.txt` for this basic simulation).
